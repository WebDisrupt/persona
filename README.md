Store local data in a secure data vault. The persona system allows you to create a profile which can flexibly store any data. The idea is that no one can access that data unless know the username and master password. The master password and username is used as the private key to unlock your data.

This library uses a combination of Argon2id hashing and AES 256 encryption which is very much infeasible to crack with current technology. This library was created so that people can encrypt their data and avoiding all data mining opperations done by malicious software and big tech. Keep your data safe with ease. 


## Installation 

You can install via NPM or download from GitHub.
```
npm i @webdisrupt/persona
```

## Getting Started
Once installed, you will need to import the package and create a new instance. Each instance can house a single logged in persona. The persona will handle all the saving and and loading of data and abstract it to simple functions.

```javascript

import { persona } from 'persona';

let persona = new persona({ 
        appName : "my-app-whereyoucanfindit-com",
        path : "C:\\custom\personas";
        recentlyLoaded : [],
        previous : {}
    });

```

### Persona Options
Although none of these parameters are technically required, we do reccommend at a bare minimium using the **appName** to help scope your data.
- **appName**: This should represent your application name and is used for scoping data. So you might want to make it a very long unique name.
- **path**: The default path is "C:\\personas". You can change this, but know that it will not detect their previous profile information. So it is not recommended to change this yourself, but instead allow the end-user to change instead.
- **RecentlyLoaded**: A minimal object referencing previously loaded profiles. There is no saving implemented for this yet, so you will have to save it yourself and pass it in on every new instance. If not provided it will load from the system.persona file.
**Persona Seed Model**
```javascript
{ 
    id: "string", 
    username: "string", 
    avatar: "Base64", 
    location: "file location" 
}
```
- **pervious**: Last loaded persona for quick reference on subsequent ussage. If not provided it will load from the system.persona file.

## API

All API calls have a standardized response object. It contains a status which provides a bool on success or failure. The second property is a customer friendly message on what happened. The last is an optional data property that contians any data requested.

**Standard response object model**
```javascript
{status: boolean, message: string, data:any}
```

## Persona Root

The persona root file is the core of the persona system and contains various standardized information. This file is json and contain a couple different encrypted pieces of data. This data can be unlocked and is the core of the persona system. It also stores all references to the data storage block which hold application specific information.

### **Create Persona**
Creating a new persona and starts referencing it in your session.
Essentially the same as creating a new account.
```javascript
persona.create("username", "password", 1);
```

### **Load Persona**
Loads an exisitng Persona and starts referencing it in your session. Essentially the same as logging in.
```javascript
persona.load("username", "password");
```

### **Save Persona**
Saves the persona that is currently referenced.
```javascript
persona.save();
```

### **Delete Persona**
 Deletes the currently referenced persona.
```javascript
persona.delete();
```

### **Unload Persona**
Unloads the currently referenced persona. Essentially the same as logging out.
```javascript
persona.unload();
```

### **Get Recently loaded Personas**
Get all recently loaded profiles.
```javascript
persona.getRecentList();
```

### **Check if user is loggedIn**
Check whether user is logged in. Additionally returns previously used simplified login data. See the **Persona Seed Model**.
```javascript
persona.isLoggedIn()
```

### **Get persona profile details.**
 Returns the loggedIn user's profile details. Note these are optional. See the **Profile Model**.
```javascript
persona.getProfile()
```
**Profile Model**
```javascript
    avatar?: string,
    firstName?: string,
    lastName?: string,
    phone?: string,
    email?: string,
    age?: Date,
    gender?: string,
    attributes?:Array<profileAttribute> // Profile Attribute is just a simple key value pair.
```

### **Save persona profile details.**
 Saves the loggedIn user's profile details. See the **Profile Model**.
```javascript
persona.saveProfile()
```

## Data Storage blocks

What are Perona data storage blocks? A chunk of data that can take any format and has been  secured using AES 256 encryption. Each block contains a unique id that is referenced by the root file. Each block contains a randomly generated file id so it cannot be identified. The id is structured as radnomFilename|uniqueApplicationName|uniqueDataBlockName. Please make your unique application name very unique to avoid collissions with other applications. This reference will be stored in your persona.root file and can be referenced after intial login is performed. 


### **Save Data Storage Block**
Saves a block of data to an existing block or creates a new block based on the application id & save sotrage id. Note: The unique id can caontain any character except **"|"** character. 
```javascript
persona.saveStorageBlock("unique-id-string", "Whatever format or data you want to save.")
```

### **Load Data Storage Block**
Loads a block of data form an existing block. Note: The unique id can caontain any character except **"|"** character. 
```javascript
persona.loadStorageBlock("unique-id-string");
```

### **Delete Data Storage Block**
Deletes a storage block. Note: The unique id can caontain any character except **"|"** character.
```javascript
persona.deleteStorageBlock("unique-id-string");
```

## The Future
I am looking to expand this library and create a way to sync data with cloud providers, peer to other devices, or self hosting. Thus creating a way to store your data as you would with a cloud provider but with them not being able to view or tamper with your data.

I would also like to increase redundancy, security, and add other cool features. If this sounds exciting and you would like to help then please don't hesitate to reach out to me. team@webdisrupt.com
